The Community Alarm Alert System is a project designed to improve safety and emergency response within a community. It provides quick alerts during incidents such as fire, theft, or accidents, allowing residents to respond and assist more effectively. The system uses simple communication tools such as sirens, mobile notifications, or a web interface to ensure that warnings reach everyone on time. It focuses on accessibility, affordability, and ease of use, making it suitable for both urban and rural communities. By enabling fast communication and promoting cooperation among residents, the system aims to reduce risks and strengthen community safety. This project demonstrates how technology can support collective security and faster emergency response.
